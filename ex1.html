					Name: Lance Jasper A. Quitalig <br><br>
					Nickname: Quits <br><br>
					Favorite CMSC Subject: CMSC 150 <br> - I really like math, so thats why I <br> liked how CMSC 150 integrated that <br> into a computer science subject <br><br>
					Favorite GE: Wika 1 <br> - I really like how my professor <br> taught the subject, it was very <br> different from the endearing <br> professors that I've heard from my <br> other friends<br><br>
					Favorite Programming Language: C <br> - because of C's verstility and how it is currently my most used language out of all of the languages I presently know <br><br>
					My semestral break felt short because our house didn't have internet connection until after I left for college. <br><br>
					I was stranded in my dorm room during the Taal eruption and just stayed here in LB from last Sunday onwards.

					My primary and singular hobby is playing video games. As long as I can get a copy of any game, AND my system can handle it, I will play it. <br>

				<h1 class = "val"> VALENZUELA </h1>
				<p class = "text" style = "top: 270px">
					I don't think that my hometown has any tourist spots aside from SM Valenzuela. So that's that.

				<h1 class = "dream"> ASTRONAUT </h1>
				<p class = "text" style = "top: 370px">
					Like most kids, my childhood dream is to be an astronaut because space is cool.
