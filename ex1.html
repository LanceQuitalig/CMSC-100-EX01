					Name: Lance Jasper A. Quitalig <br><br>
					Nickname: Quits <br><br>
					Favorite CMSC Subject: CMSC 150 <br> - I really like math, so thats why I <br> liked how CMSC 150 integrated that <br> into a computer science subject <br><br>
					Favorite GE: Wika 1 <br> - I really like how my professor <br> taught the subject, it was very <br> different from the endearing <br> professors that I've heard from my <br> other friends<br><br>
					Favorite Programming Language: C <br> - because of C's verstility and how it is currently my most used language out of all of the languages I presently know <br><br>
					My semestral break felt short because our house didn't have internet connection until after I left for college. <br><br>
					I was stranded in my dorm room during the Taal eruption and just stayed here in LB from last Sunday onwards.
